{
    // Per-stat tolerance for ours-vs-leetify comparisons.
    //
    // Tolerance rationale, in three groups:
    //
    //   1. STRICT (=0.0) — counts where we've achieved exact parity with
    //      Leetify across all 5 bench demos. A divergence here is a real
    //      regression. Keep at 0.0.
    //
    //   2. PROVIDER ROUNDING — small float headroom for legitimate display-
    //      precision differences between providers. Kd is computed by both
    //      sides and rounded; 0.02 covers observed jitter.
    //
    //   3. DOCUMENTED RESIDUAL — stats with known parity gaps that were
    //      investigated in the May 2026 correctness pass and deferred with
    //      written rationale in /KNOWN-AND-SUSPECTED-ISSUES.md. Each
    //      tolerance below is set to the CURRENT max |Δ| observed across
    //      the 5-demo bench suite (as of the May 2026 pass). Setting tolerance
    //      at exactly the current ceiling preserves the regression-tripwire
    //      property — any future drift that pushes |Δ| above today's
    //      ceiling fails the test. Closure path: tighten the parser, then
    //      tighten the tolerance here, then update the issues doc.
    //
    // The strict ground-truth gate is OursVsExpected_StatParity (zero
    // tolerance against hand-verified expected.golden.json). When expected
    // fixtures cover more demos, this Leetify-side comparison becomes
    // secondary signal — until then it's the primary parity check.
