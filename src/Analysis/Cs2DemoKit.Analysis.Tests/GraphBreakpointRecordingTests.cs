///     Phase-0 foundation tests for the Analysis-graph breakpoint feature. They pin the two
///     load-bearing pieces the rest of the feature builds on:
///     <list type="number">
///         <item>
///             <b>The descriptor → <see cref="StateEdge" /> bridge</b> (<see cref="BuildResult.EdgeBacking" />).
///             The visualization layer hands back a <see cref="GraphEdgeDescriptor" /> when an edge is
///             clicked; an edge breakpoint must resolve that to the runtime <see cref="StateEdge" /> whose
///             fires were recorded. The descriptor never holds the edge — the two are born in the same
///             build-loop iteration sharing <c>Source</c>/<c>Destination</c> node refs — so this asserts
///             the map is built and is coverage-correct.
///         </item>
///         <item>
///             <b>The applied-index recording</b> (<see cref="EvaluationResult.AppliedMessagesByEdge" />).
///             For each fired edge, the sorted global message indices at which it applied — recorded
///             side-effect-free during the single eval pass. The index alignment is the subtle part:
///             a recorded index must point at the exact message that fired the edge, proven here by
///             checking the decoded-event type at that index matches the edge's dispatch key.
///         </item>
///     </list>
///     Re-hosted on the built-in context edges (the game-scoped trigger edges every build wires)
///     after the Rulesets v1 chain layer was removed.
