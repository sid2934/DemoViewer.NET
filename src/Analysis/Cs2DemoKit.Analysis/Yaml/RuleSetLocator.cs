                                           Any `.yaml` file you put in this directory is loaded on top of the shipped analysis rules.
                                           Rules are written as **Rulesets v2** documents (a `ruleset:` file). Name your files
                                           `<name>.rules.yaml` — that is also what the in-app Rule Workbench lists and edits:

                                           - A ruleset with the **same `ruleset:` id** as a shipped one **replaces it entirely** — to
                                             customize a shipped stat, copy the whole `.rules.yaml` file from the shipped `rules/`
                                             directory (next to the app) into this folder and edit it.
                                           - A ruleset with a **new id** adds brand-new stats. Give it a `show:` section to surface
                                             them in the stats tables and exports.
                                           - To **turn off** a shipped ruleset without redefining it, declare just its id with
                                             `enabled: false`:

                                             ```yaml
                                             ruleset: some_shipped_ruleset
                                             enabled: false
                                             ```

                                           Files load in name order. Ruleset ids must be unique within this directory. Errors in a
                                           file here never break analysis — the file is skipped and the problems are reported in
                                           the app.

                                           Start a file with the line below to get editor validation and autocompletion (the schema
                                           is copied into this folder for you):

                                           ```yaml
                                           # yaml-language-server: $schema=./dv-rules.schema.json
                                           ```

                                           The old v1 format (a `chains:` document) is retired and no longer loads — a v1 file in
                                           this folder is reported as an error in the app. Write all files as `ruleset:` documents.
