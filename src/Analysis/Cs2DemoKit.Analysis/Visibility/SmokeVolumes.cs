///         <b>Why vision-only:</b> smoke blocks <i>sight</i> but not bullets, so it belongs on could-see (what
///         a player can actually SEE), never on <c>exposed</c> (geometric line of fire). exposed is a triangle
///         raycast against static map collision, in which smoke doesn't exist, so exposed is smoke-blind by
///         construction and this helper is only ever consulted for could-see. The observable consequence — a
