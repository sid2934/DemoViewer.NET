///     matching events whose first-to-last span is within <c>windowTicks</c> — then, as an
///     <see cref="ITransientNode" />, auto-clears (<see cref="BoolNode.Deactivate" />) before the next
///     dispatch of its event type, so the highlight's rising-edge machinery fires exactly once at the
///     completing event's tick (the correct clip anchor).
///     <para>
///         Unlike <see cref="WindowedStreakNode" /> (a match counter finalized at round end / on a
///         window break), this is a TRUE sliding window: the test is <c>tick − oldest-of-last-minCount
///         ≤ windowTicks</c>, so N events spread just beyond the window do not qualify. A <c>_fired</c>
///         latch holds across a continuous burst so one sustained spray fires ONCE (kills that keep
///         landing inside the rolling window are the same burst); the latch re-arms only when a
///         qualifying window no longer forms (the sequence broke), letting a genuinely new burst fire.
