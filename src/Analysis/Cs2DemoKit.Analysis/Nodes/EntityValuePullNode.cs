/// <summary>
///     A per-player entity-value PULL-node (B6-style — see <see cref="RoundTeamAggregateNode" />) that
///     exposes the SUBJECT slot's current per-player entity-provider value (e.g.
///     <c>player.entity.pawn.health</c>) as a reflectively-read <see cref="Value" />, recomputed live on
///     every read from the shared <see cref="EntityChangeScanner" />'s pre-frame snapshot
///     (<see cref="EntityChangeScanner.GetPreFrameValue" /> — the very accessor the fire-time
///     <c>where:</c>/value-selector entity seam uses). It closes the last entity-read gap: <c>compute:</c>
///     (round-end / live-settle) and <c>flag: when:</c> (flag-eval) are pure node-logic sites with no
///     event frame, so they cannot reach the fire-time <see cref="Building.ExpressionCompiler.CompileEventCondition" />
///     entity seam. Materializing the subject's entity value as this always-active pull-node lets those
///     sites read it as an ordinary graph-node value (a reflective <c>Value</c>), exactly as the B6
///     aggregate nodes are read.
///     <para>
///         TIMING: the read is at SETTLE time — the entity state captured at the most recent frame
///         advance (the round-end state for a round-end <c>compute:</c>, the flag-evaluation state for a
///         <c>when:</c>) — distinct from the AT-FIRE timing a <c>where:</c>/value-selector read correctly
///         uses. Both are valid; the timing follows the site. Because <see cref="EntityChangeScanner" />
///         snapshots every live slot on every frame advance, at round-end this pre-frame value is the
///         round-end value.
///     </para>
///     <para>
///         Excluded from snapshots (<see cref="ISnapshotExcludedNode" />): a derived context value,
///         invisible in output. A not-yet-snapshotted slot (pre-spawn, or the very first frame) degrades
///         to the provider default (0) — never throws at read. A missing scanner is a BUILD-time error
///         (mirrors the <c>where:</c> entity seam's compile-time "requires per-player entity providers"
///         throw), raised where this node is materialized, not here at read.
