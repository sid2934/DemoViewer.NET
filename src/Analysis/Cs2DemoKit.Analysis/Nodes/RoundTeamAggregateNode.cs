///     A per-player B6 team-aggregate node whose integer <see cref="Value" /> is recomputed live from
///     <see cref="PlayerContextIndex" /> on every read — the single-writer design
///     (docs/rules-v2/rule-authoring-ux-review.md §3.3 risk 1 decision a): the alive index is mutated by
///     exactly one writer (the <c>MarkDead</c> edge, plus round reset / connectivity), and these
///     aggregates are pure derivations of that index. There is deliberately NO second incremental
///     store to drift out of sync.

///         (so a halftime side-swap is reflected), and the enemy side is its complement. Because it
///         reflects the index at read time, a read during a <c>player_death</c> dispatch sees deaths
