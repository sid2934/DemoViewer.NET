///     decision c): once per player at <c>round_freeze_end</c> it writes the subject's
///     <c>round.team.equipment</c> and <c>round.enemies.equipment</c> nodes from the digest-sampled
///     absolute team economy sums plus the subject's team, so every downstream read is a pure

///         production a closure over the scanner's pre-frame <c>entity.pawn.equipment_value</c>
///         snapshot (the same entity-digest substrate <c>enrich.hurt.victim_health_before</c> uses).
///         There is no driving event to fold this into (unlike the alive counts), so it samples at the
