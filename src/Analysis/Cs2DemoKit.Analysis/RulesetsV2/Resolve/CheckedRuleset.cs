///     The <b>CheckedRuleset IR</b> — the planner's input. It is the

///     <see cref="RulesetDoc" />: defines inlined, params bound to literals, views resolved per
///     demo-source profile, every expression slot normalized and typed. It carries resolved
///     concrete-event sets, canonical ASTs, compound scope axes, keep-specs, declared reads, and
///     entity-provider references — but <b>no hashes and no graph</b>. The planner constructs the
///     <c>StateNode</c>/<c>StateEdge</c>/<c>BuildResult</c> and runs the resolved-identity hasher;
///     this IR only feeds it.
