///     the closed-generic <see cref="EntityValueChangedEvent{TMarker}" /> directly —
///     the dispatch key (<c>typeof(EntityValueChangedEvent&lt;TMarker&gt;)</c>) is
///     specific to each (entity class, field path) pair, so rule-chain dispatch routes
///     each subscription independently with no shared dispatch list overhead.
