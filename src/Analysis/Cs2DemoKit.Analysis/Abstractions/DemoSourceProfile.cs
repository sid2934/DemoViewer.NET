/// <summary>
///     Engine-side profile describing the event vocabulary a demo source emits.
///     Implementations bind logical event names (<c>RoundEnd</c>,
///     <c>PlayerBlind</c>, …) to ordered lists of concrete game events. The
///     analysis evaluator's rule builder consults these bindings at build
///     time to expand <c>$logical</c> trigger references into concrete
///     event subscriptions, so source-awareness has zero runtime cost.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
///     A logical-event accessor returning <c>null</c> means "this source
///     does not emit any concrete event for this logical concept" — for
///     example, the HLTV profile returns <c>null</c> for
///     <see cref="PlayerBlind" /> because HLTV demos lack the underlying
///     <c>player_blind</c> event entirely. Rules that strictly require
///     such an event should declare a <c>requires:</c> field listing the
///     logical events they need; the rule builder skips those rules
///     silently when the active profile lacks them.
///     Adding a new logical event to this base class is non-breaking —
///     all existing implementations inherit the default <c>null</c>
///     return. Override what your source supports and leave the rest.
///     Authors writing custom profiles for unusual sources can extend
///     this class directly. A future release will support loading such
///     subclasses from external assemblies; for v0.0.2 only the
///     internally-shipped profiles are recognised.
