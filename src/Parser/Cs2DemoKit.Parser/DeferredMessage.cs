/// <summary>
///     A net-message payload kept in its raw wire form and not yet expanded into its protobuf object
///     graph. It IS a valid on-the-wire message; it simply defers the (sometimes very expensive)
///     deserialization until a consumer actually needs the typed view.
///     <para>
///         <b>Why this exists.</b> Some message types are eagerly parsed on every demo load but read by
///         almost nothing. <c>svc_UserCmds</c> is the extreme case: ~1.37M messages on a single 279 MB
///         demo, ~530 MiB retained for the life of the <see cref="ParsedDemo" /> (58% of it), yet the
///         only consumers are two lazy UI features (the Replay tab's subtick view and the Parser-tab
///         inspector). Deferring the parse drops that object-graph overhead for every load that never
///         opens those views: all of AnalysisBench, the analysis engine, Library background parse, and
///         highlight backfill.
///     </para>
///     <para>
///         <b>Why implementing <see cref="IMessage" /> is the right layer</b> (rather than changing the
///         <see cref="NetMessage" /> contract). The four <see cref="IMessage" /> members all delegate to
///         <see cref="Materialize" />, so the payload behaves exactly like the real message the instant
///         anyone invokes one. The win does not come from faking those members; it comes from the fact
///         that <b>the hot path never invokes them</b>. Entity tracking and the analysis engine only ask
///         <c>Payload is CConcrete</c>, a pure type-identity test that calls no interface member and
///         correctly evaluates <c>false</c> for a deferred payload (those layers do not read subtick data
///         anyway). Only the two real consumers, plus per-message display of a selected frame, ever touch
///         a member and thereby materialize: exactly when the typed view is genuinely needed. This keeps
///         the load-bearing <see cref="NetMessage" /> / <see cref="DemoFrame" /> contract untouched and
///         its ~20 consumers working unchanged.
///     </para>
///     <para>
///         <b>The one seam.</b> <c>Payload is CSVCMsg_UserCommands</c> is <c>false</c> until
///         <see cref="Materialize" /> runs. Consumers that genuinely need the typed message call
///         <see cref="TryMaterialize{T}" /> (or <see cref="Materialize" />); everything else is
///         intentionally blind to it. Materialization is cached and idempotent.
