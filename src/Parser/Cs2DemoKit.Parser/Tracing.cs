///     <c>CSVCMsg_PacketEntities</c> packet so a decode failure can be root-caused down to the
///     offending field read. Lives in the Parser assembly (the lowest common layer) so
///     EntityTracking, the bench, and the App all read the exact same flag.

///         <b>Independent of <see cref="Profiling" /> by design.</b> Profiling gates timing
///         accumulators on the hot path; tracing gates the per-op <c>DecodeTraceEntry</c>
///         construction + buffer append. They are deliberately separate switches: you want the
///         decode trace <i>without</i> paying for timing instrumentation, and the timing profile
///         <i>without</i> the ~7 M-entry-per-load trace overhead polluting the measurement. Either
///         can be on without the other.

///         environment variable (<c>1</c>/<c>true</c>/<c>yes</c>, case-insensitive) the first time it
///         is touched, so a general run pays nothing but a single predicted branch on each gated
///         site's disabled path — and builds no trace entry. Turn it on via that env var at process
///         start, or programmatically via the <see cref="Enabled" /> setter (e.g. a deliberate
///         re-run to capture the full bit-trace of a decode error a default run only breadcrumbed).

///         <i>before</i> the run it governs begins; the <c>Parallel.For</c> fork is a full memory
///         barrier, so every worker observes the pre-fork value. A plain <see cref="bool" /> is
