# Cs2DemoKit.Parser

A zero-copy parser for CS2 (Counter-Strike 2) `.dem` files. Parses the frame stream directly off
the input buffer with no intermediate copies, decodes 272 typed game events, and includes
`EntityTracker` for stateful entity replay (player positions, health, weapons, …). Typed entity
wrappers (`CSPlayerPawn`, `CSGameRules`, `WeaponAWP`, …) come from the companion
`CS2OpenDev.Sdk.Entities` package and bind over this runtime through the
`Entities/SdkAbstractions` seam (`LensBoundReader` / `TrackerEntityWorld`). Targets `net10.0`.

This package has no knowledge of rules, stats, or highlights — see `Cs2DemoKit.Analysis` for that.
Dependencies: `Google.Protobuf`, `Snappier`, and `CS2OpenDev.Sdk.Entities.Abstractions` (the
entity read contract the seam implements).

## Quickstart

```csharp
using Cs2DemoKit.Parser;
using Cs2DemoKit.Parser.GameEvents;

// A stable file already fully written to disk — the memory-mapped path avoids putting the whole
// file on the managed heap.
ParsedDemo demo = MemoryMappedDemoSource.ParseFile(path);

foreach (GameEvent evt in demo.AllGameEvents)
{
    if (evt is PlayerDeathEvent death)
    {
        PlayerInfo? victim = demo.Players.GetValueOrDefault(death.VictimSlot);
        PlayerInfo? killer = demo.Players.GetValueOrDefault(death.KillerSlot);
        Console.WriteLine($"tick {death.GameTick}: {killer?.SteamId64} killed {victim?.SteamId64} with {death.Weapon}");
    }
}
```

`ParsedDemo.Players` is keyed by player **slot** (`int`), the same key every typed game event uses
for its slot-shaped fields (`VictimSlot`, `KillerSlot`, …) — join through it to get `PlayerInfo`
(`SteamId64`, `Name`, `Team`, …).

## Tick clocks — read this before touching ticks

| Property | Clock | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `DemoFrame.ServerTick` (`int`) | **frame clock** | Despite the name, this holds the game tick in CS2 — pre-game frames carry a large negative sentinel, gameplay frames run 1, 2, 3, … There is no `DemoFrame.Tick`. |
| `DemoFrame.GameTick` (`int?`) | **frame clock** | An alias of `ServerTick`, set by the parser after the header decodes. |
| `GameEvent.GameTick` (`int`) | **frame clock** | Same clock as the two above. |
| `GameEvent.ServerTick` (`int`) | **absolute** engine tick | Convert to frame clock with `GameEvent.ServerTick - ParsedDemo.ServerStartTick`. |

**Rule: never subtract `ParsedDemo.ServerStartTick` from a value that is already frame clock**
(`DemoFrame.ServerTick`/`GameTick`, `GameEvent.GameTick`). Only the absolute `GameEvent.ServerTick`
needs that conversion.

## Input: buffer vs. file path

`DemoParser.Parse(ReadOnlyMemory<byte> data, DemoProfile? profileOverride = null)` is the parser's
one entry point. `MemoryMappedDemoSource` wraps a local file as a `ReadOnlyMemory<byte>` without
materializing it as a managed array; `MemoryMappedDemoSource.ParseFile(path)` is the one-line
convenience over `Open` + `Parse`.

- **Uploaded / in-flight demos → `byte[]`.** `DemoParser.Parse(bytes.AsMemory())` snapshots the
  bytes up front, so it's safe even if the source is still being written or copied concurrently.
- **Stable files already fully on disk → `MemoryMappedDemoSource`.** Cheaper (~166 MB avoided on
  the large-object heap for a 180 MB demo), but **only for files that will not be written to while
  mapped**: a concurrent truncation while a page is mapped raises an uncatchable
  `AccessViolationException` that kills the process — no `try`/`catch` around the read fires. Don't
  map a file mid-download or mid-copy.
- The memory-mapped path rejects files over `int.MaxValue` (~2 GB) — a single `ReadOnlyMemory<byte>`
  can't address more. The `byte[]` path has no explicit guard, but is bounded by the same
  `int`-typed frame offsets internally, so plan for the same ceiling either way.
- A parse retains roughly **2.5× the input file's size** in the returned `ParsedDemo` (frames, decoded
  proto messages, event/player indexes). Size worker pools and per-process demo-concurrency limits
  against that multiplier, not the raw file size.
- Per-parse control (0.8+): `DemoParser.Parse(data, new ParseOptions { ... }, profileOverride)` —
  `CancellationToken` (checked at pass boundaries and per frame in the parallel pass),
  `MaxDegreeOfParallelism` for the parallel decode
  pass (null/≤0 = unbounded), throttled `IProgress<double>`, and `OnUnknownMessage`, a per-parse
  callback that doesn't cross-talk between concurrent parses the way the static
  `OnUnknownMessageType` event does. Still gate the number of concurrent *demos* with your own
  `SemaphoreSlim` sized to the ~2.5× memory multiplier.
- Scoring an untrusted upload: set `ParseOptions.CountDropSites = true` — silently-dropped
  net-messages then surface on `ParsedDemo.Warnings` as `ParseWarningCodes.NetMessageDropped`
  entries (top offenders + remainder, each with a `Count`), emitted after the parse's own
  structural warnings so they never displace them.

## Parse warnings

`ParsedDemo.Warnings` (`IReadOnlyList<ParseWarning>`) carries non-fatal, structured diagnostics —
a damaged demo still yields a usable partial parse, but the damage is no longer silent. Each
`ParseWarning` has a stable `Code` from `ParseWarningCodes` (`StringTableCreateFailed`,
`StringTableUpdateFailed`, `StringTableTruncated`, `PlayerInfoUnreadable`), a human `Message`, and
an optional `Tick`.

The list is capped at 256 entries per parse; once the cap is hit, a final entry with code
`ParseWarningCodes.WarningsTruncated` reports how many further warnings were suppressed — it is
always the last entry when present.

**Pool-consumer caveat:** the accumulator behind `Warnings` is thread-affine (`[ThreadStatic]`),
drained into the `ParsedDemo` you get back and reset on that same thread. If a parse **throws**
before constructing its `ParsedDemo`, its warnings are left on that thread; the next successful
parse on the *same* thread drains them along with its own, so a dead parse's warnings can end up
misattributed to whatever parse runs next on that thread. This only bites if you run parses on a
reused thread pool (e.g. `Task.Run` over a shared pool) and something upstream swallows the
exception from a failed parse — treat `Warnings` on the following result on that thread as suspect
in that case.

## Entity tracking

Build a lens-bound tracker in one call: `EntityTrackerFactory.CreateCurated()` binds the
generated Schema Lens (omitting it does not throw — lane-routed reads silently degrade to the
fallback dict, so prefer the factory). To read through typed wrappers, register the
`CS2OpenDev.Sdk.Entities` factories via `TrackerEntityWorld.RegisterWrapper` (or bind a wrapper
per entity with `new TrackerEntityWorld(tracker).CreateReader(binding, state)`).
`AdvanceTo`/`AdvanceToIndex` replay from frame 0 on **every** call; for forward walks use
`EntityStateLayer` in `Cs2DemoKit.Analysis` instead. Decode diagnostics go to
`EntityTracker.DecodeDiagnosticSink` (`Action<string>`, defaults to `Console.WriteLine`) — redirect
or silence it per tracker in batch services. `PositionUtil.CellToWorld` /
`CellToWorldVector` (namespace `Cs2DemoKit.Parser.EntityTracking`) is the oracle-pinned pawn
cell→world reconstruction; `TickMapper` and `TickBoundaries.FrameIndices` cover demo-tick mapping
and tick-boundary frame indexing.

## Working with raw net messages

Generated Valve proto types (`CDemoPacket`, `CSVCMsg_PacketEntities`, `CCSUsrMsg_*`, …) live in
`CS2OpenSchema.Protos`, not the global namespace — add the `using` to pattern-match
`NetMessage.Payload`. They ship in the `CS2OpenDev.Protos` package, which comes along as a
dependency of this one:

```csharp
using CS2OpenSchema.Protos;

foreach (NetMessage msg in frame.InnerMessages)
{
    if (msg.Payload is CSVCMsg_PacketEntities entities)
    {
        // ...
    }
}
```

## Legacy identifiers

Two environment variables gate opt-in diagnostics and keep their original names for compatibility
with existing installs and scripts: `DEMOVIEWER_PROFILE=1` enables the parse-profiling accumulator,
`DEMOVIEWER_TRACE_DECODE=1` enables verbose entity-decode tracing. Both default to off and cost
nothing when unset.
