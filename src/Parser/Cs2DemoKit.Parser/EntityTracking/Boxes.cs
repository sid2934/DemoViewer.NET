///         <b>Why this exists.</b> Every field the decoder cannot place in a typed lane is written to
///         <see cref="EntityState.SetFallback" />, whose value parameter is <c>object?</c> — so each
///         decoded <c>int</c> allocates a 24-byte box. Measured on one 279 MB demo: <b>14,303,518</b>
///         such writes, of which <b>99.9%</b> carried a value in <c>[0, 256)</c> — roughly 340 MiB of
///         boxes whose contents repeat a few hundred distinct values. Handing out shared boxes for the
///         cached range removes that allocation entirely; anything outside it boxes as before.
///     </para>
///     <para>
///         <b>Why sharing is safe.</b> A box is immutable — nothing in the codebase unboxes by
///         reference (no <c>Unsafe.Unbox</c>), and <see cref="EntityState.FreezeCopy" /> already
///         documents that lane and fallback values "are themselves treated as immutable ... so a
///         shallow element copy is a correct freeze". The one place object identity is observed is
///         the change-detection fast path in the analysis scanner,
///         <c>ReferenceEquals(newValue, last) || Equals(newValue, last)</c> — sharing can only make
///         the reference arm hit where the <c>Equals</c> arm already would have, so the result is
///         unchanged and the comparison gets cheaper.
