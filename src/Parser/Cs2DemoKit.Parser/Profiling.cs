///     The single, process-wide runtime switch for ALL DemoViewer profiling instrumentation
///     (parse-pipeline, entity-decode, and the analysis evaluator's accumulator trees). Lives in the
///     Parser assembly — the lowest common layer every other project references — so EntityTracking,
///     Analysis, the bench, and the App all read the exact same flag.
///     <para>
///         <b>Default:</b> off. The flag resolves once from the <c>DEMOVIEWER_PROFILE</c> environment
///         variable (<c>1</c>/<c>true</c>/<c>yes</c>, case-insensitive) the first time it is touched, so a
///         general user who never sets that env var pays nothing but a single predicted branch on each
///         instrumented seam's disabled path. Profiling is turned on either by that env var at process
///         start, or programmatically via the <see cref="Enabled" /> setter (the bench's <c>--profile</c>
///         flag and the Diagnostics tab use the setter).
///     </para>
///     <para>
///         <b>Threading contract — set before the run.</b> <see cref="Enabled" /> is read on
///         <c>Parallel.For</c> worker threads (parse pass-2, the parallel digest producer). The flag must be
///         set <i>before</i> the run it governs begins; the <c>Parallel.For</c> fork is a full memory
///         barrier, so every worker observes the pre-fork value. A plain <see cref="bool" /> is sufficient
///         under this contract (≤ word-size reads are atomic per ECMA-335; no torn read). Hot-path call
///         sites that fan out additionally snapshot the flag into a local immediately before forking and
///         close over that local, so all workers in one run see one consistent value even if the contract
///         is ever violated mid-flight.

///         (<c>ParseProfiler</c> statics, the per-tracker / per-scanner fields, the parallel producer's
///         per-worker alloc sum) assume one profiled run is in flight at a time, with the flag set before it
///         starts. The bench is single-shot per process; the App profiles via a deliberate reload / re-run.
///         Overlapping concurrent profiled runs would interleave the static accumulators — not a supported
