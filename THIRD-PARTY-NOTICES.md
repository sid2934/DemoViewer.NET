# Third-Party Notices

This repository is licensed under the MIT License (see `LICENSE`). It also contains code
adapted from a third-party MIT-licensed project, and generates code from third-party protobuf
definitions. Both are documented below.

## a. demofile-net (MIT)

Eight files in the parser ship code adapted from
[demofile-net](https://github.com/saul/demofile-net), an MIT-licensed CS2/Source demo parser.
These files all ship in the `Cs2DemoKit.Parser` assembly (`src/Parser/Cs2DemoKit.Parser/`), which
is published as the `Cs2DemoKit.Parser` package:

- `BitBuffer.cs`
- `RuntimeField.cs`
- `EntityTracker.cs`
- `HuffmanNode.cs`
- `FieldDecoderFactory.cs`
- `FieldPathEncoding.cs`
- `FieldPath.cs`
- `FieldEncodingInfo.cs`

## b. Valve protobuf definitions

The parser assembly contains C# code generated from protobuf definitions originating from
Valve's Counter-Strike 2, as tracked by [SteamDatabase/GameTracking-CS2](https://github.com/SteamDatabase/GameTracking-CS2)
(consumed via the `sid2934/CS2-OpenDevDocs` submodule). These definitions describe a wire
format. Valve Corporation owns Counter-Strike 2 and its data formats. This project is
unaffiliated with Valve. No game assets are redistributed in the packages.

## c. Other package dependencies

This project depends on the following NuGet packages, each under its own license, resolved
via NuGet and not reproduced here: Google.Protobuf, Snappier, YamlDotNet,
Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Abstractions, CS2OpenDev.Sdk.
